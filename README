This repo is for smaller projects that don't merit their own git repo.

Folders:
	* /patches:		Patches for open-source projects that aren't
				submitted upstream for various reasons.
	* /tools:		Scripts and such I share across all my machines
				live here so they all stay up-to-date.
	* /fun-hacks:		Things I've written that may be of interest.
	* /resume:		My resume.
