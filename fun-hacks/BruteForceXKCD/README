Brute force the XKCD hash target.

VERY hastily thrown together from: git://das-labor.org/users/bg/avr-crypto-lib

Pass the number of threads as the only argument. It connects to XKCD and submits
the text whenever it finds a new low hash.

Does about 1.4M hashes/sec on a 12-core Xeon server (w/ 24 HT's), and about 85k/sec
on my little Core2 laptop.

NOTE: You can't POST non-alphanumeric hashes using your browser, because the xkcd
site does not treat them as urlencoded. You have to actually send the raw data.
The POST asprintf() works, but you can also use curl from the command line:

curl --data 'hashable=|I&zpT<FJ3H=ZBaZ:\ a|-ka6HEQ|w!' http://almamater.xkcd.com/?edu=smu.edu
