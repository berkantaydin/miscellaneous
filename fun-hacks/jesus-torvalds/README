@JesusTorvalds: Tweets randomly generated from a corpus consisting of all the
		direct quotes from Jesus in the bible, and a dump of all of
		Linus' E-Mails to linux-kernel over the past year or so.

This is the script that runs on a server of mine to generate tweets for the
twitter handle @JesusTorvalds. It's based on the traditional Mark V Shaney
text generation algo, but in order to make sure we get funny combinations of
Jesus and Linus, it generates 64 potential tweets and ranks them based on
how many words from each corpus are included, preferring those closest to half
and half. It limits to 140 characters for tweets: the results are generally
funnier if you let them be longer, but obviously on Twitter I didn't have
much of a choice.

I actually got the idea from Linus himself:

The results are generally pretty funny. About half of them don't make a lot of
gramattical sense, it would be nice to improve that aspect. I think that's
mostly just the way it has to be because of the old/new English justaposition,
but if you see a way to improve it, send me patches!
