This is a completely written-from-scratch implementation of RSA.

It's utterly useless for any practical application, but as a tool for
understanding how RSA works I think it could be instructive. Most of the
real-world implementations are rather inaccessible, and despite accessibility
not being an explicit goal when I wrote this, it's still much easier to
understand than the RSA implementation in, say, OpenSSL.

(At the very least, the process of writing it was very instructive for me...)

I wrote this *very* quickly a while ago. It's horrendously slow, in large part
because I used implemented division as shift-and-subtract for the BIGNUMs.

In case this doesn't go without saying: DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS IRL. Timing
attacks abound (I didn't even think about this while writing it), and it
encrypts raw data directly, which for RSA is a big no-no.

Build with `make debug`, or it will look like nothing is happening.
