DataBlaster
---------------------
This is a (currently very limited) simple utility that will transfer a file
across the network at a constant specified bandwidth, disregarding data loss.
Currently, lost blocks of data are noted and re-transmitted after the fact
over TCP, but this is obviously non-ideal.

Portability between 32/64 bit x86en has been tested; portability to other
architectures *should* work, but is not guaranteed. Specifically, it is
assumed that using XtoXl() on the high and low 32-bits of a 64-bit integer (and
subsequent shifting) is sufficient to translate back and forth to big endian
ordering.

Current arguments:
	db -S filename src_port dst_addr dst_port speed (integer, MB/s)
	db -R filename src_port recv_addr recv_port
