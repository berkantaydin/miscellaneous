Chess-engine: A (currently very simplistic) chess AI, written in C

This isn't very serious, just something I've enjoyed playing around with. I
haven't had enough time to really finish it. The current implementation ignores
En Passant and Castling, since these are the only chess moves that have
hysteresis. It also ignores promotion.

More laughably, it doesn't understand check or checkmate, and uses a very naive
heuristic based on point values of pieces. So it doesn't actually play to win
chess, it plays to maximize it's point advantage over the opposing player.
